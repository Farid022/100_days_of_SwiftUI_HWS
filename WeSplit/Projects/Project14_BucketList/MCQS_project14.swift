 1. The Comparable protocol requires that we tell Swift whether one object should be sorted before another of the same type. This is its only requirement.
2.  iOS can take care of file encryption for using the .completeFileProtection option.
 This stops anyone from reading the file unless the device has been unlocked.
 
3. MapAnnotation lets us place any kind of SwiftUI views into our maps. True

4. If a type conforms to Comparable we get a version of sorted() that takes no parameters. True
 
5.  Writing data atomically means that iOS writes to a temporary file then performs a rename.
 This stops another piece of code from reading the file part-way through a write.
 
6. Swift's strings and integers already conform to Comparable.
 This means Swift can sort arrays of strings and integers natively.

7. Our documents directory can hold text or JSON, but nothing else.
 You can store whatever data you want in there, but remember not to waste space.

 8. The CL in CLLocationCoordinate2D stands for Core Location. True
 
 9.  Touch ID and Face ID are both provided by the LocalAuthentication framework.
 
 10. SwiftUI does not let us bind a text field directly to an optional string property.
 We can however bind a computed property that wraps the optional.
 
 11. Calling data(from:) on a URLSession must be done with await.
 Networking takes some time to complete, so you should never let it block your UI work.
 
 12. Map annotation data must conform to Identifiable. true.
 
 13. Even if our app gets deleted, its documents directory will still remain on the device. false
